        Polymorphism :
                    1.Base class pointer and derived class object
                    2.Virtual function
                    3.Abstract class


        when we create pointer of base class and object of derived class then
        base class object always initiated so we use virtual function to access the
        feature of derived class and if we want that base class object never
        initated then we use abstract class.

        3.Abstract class :
            ->abstract class is used when we never want to initiate base class.

            -> if pure virtual function exist in any class then that class become
            abstract class.

            ->if we don't want to perform any activity of base class then we use
            pure virtual function.
