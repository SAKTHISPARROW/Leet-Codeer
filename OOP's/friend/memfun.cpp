    Friend Function

        Like a friend class, a friend function can be granted special access to
        private and protected members of a class in C++. They are the non-member
        functions that can access and manipulate the private and protected members
        of the class for they are declared as friends.

        A friend function can be:

            a) A global function
                We can declare any global function as a friend function.
                The following example demonstrates how to declare a global
                function as a friend function in C++:

            b) A member function of another class
                We can also declare a member function of another class as a friend function
                in C++. The following example demonstrates how to use a member function of
                another class as a friend function in C++:

/*
    The order in which we define the friend function of another class is important
    and should be taken care of. We always have to define both the classes before
    the function definition. Thats why we have used out of class member function
    definition.
